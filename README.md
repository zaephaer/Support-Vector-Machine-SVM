# Support-Vector-Machine-SVM

**About**<br>
Support Vector Machine is a supervised learning algorithm mostly used for classification but it can be used also for regression. The main idea
is that based on the labeled data (training data) the algorithm tries to find the optimal hyperplane which can be used to classify new data points. In
two dimensions the hyperplane is a simple line <br>
